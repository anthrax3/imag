# Modules {#sec:modules}

A module is a functionality of the program.
There is a huge list of modules available in the imag core distribution.

Some of the modules shipped with imag cover core functionality such as
linking, tagging or references to files outside of the store or even the store
interface itself.
Others cover things like diary, notes, wiki or bookmarks.
These are also called "domains".

We try really hard to offer a consistent commandline user interface over all of
these modules.

The following sections describe each module in detail, including its purpose and
its provided functionality.
